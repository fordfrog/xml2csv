Usage: java -jar xml2csv-*.jar --columns <columns> --input <file> --output <file>

General command line switches:

--columns <columns>
    List of columns that should be output to the CSV file. These names must
    correspond to the element names within the item element.
--input <file>
    Path to the input XML file.
--output <file>
    Path to the output CSV file. Output file content is always in UTF-8 encoding.
--separator <character>
	Character that should be used to separate fields. Default value is (;). 
--trim
	Trim values. By default values are not trimmed. 
--join
	Join values of multiple elements into single value using (, ) as a separator. 
	By default value of the first element is saved to CSV. 

Filtering rows:

--filter-column <name>
    Column on which the filter should be applied. When specifying filter command
    line switches, you must use this switch as the first one as it initializes
    new filter. You can specify more filters, each one beginning with this
    switch. You can filter the rows even on columns that are not part of the
    output. Filtering is performed before remapping.
..filter.values <file>
    Path to file containing values that the filter should use. Empty rows are
    added to the values too.
--filter-exclude
    Excludes all rows where the column value matches one of the specified values.
--filter-include
    Includes all rows where the column value matches one of the specified values.
    This is the default behavior if --filter-exclude|--filter-include is not
    specified.

Remapping (replacing) values:

--remap-column <name>
    Column in which original values should be replaced with values from map
    file. When specifying remapping command line switches, you must use this
    switch as the first one as it initializes new remapping. You can specify
    more remappings, each one beginning with this switch. Remapping is performed
    after filtering.
--remap-map <file>
    Path to file containing original value and new value pairs. The file uses
    CSV format. Values can be escaped either using single-quote (') or
    double-quote ("). Quotes within values can be escaped either doubling them
    ("" and '') or backslash-escaping them (\" and \').

Characters encoding:

    Application expects all files being in UTF-8 encoding.
